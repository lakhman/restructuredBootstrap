.. panel-info:: Panel List Node Last

  Here's a paragraph inside the panel, it's rendered inside a ``.panel-body``.

  The list below is not!

  - `List 1 <https://google.com>`_
  - `List 2 <https://google.com>`_
  - `List 3 <https://google.com>`_

.. Tests lists inside a panel are rendered outside the `.panel-body`
.. Tests multiple nodes, the list should be outside the panel LAST, the paragraphs inside.
