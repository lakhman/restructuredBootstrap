.. panel-info:: Panel Table Node Last

  Here's a paragraph inside the panel, it's rendered inside a ``.panel-body``.

  The table below is not!

  =====  =====  =======
    x      y       z
  =====  =====  =======
    1      2       3
    1      3       4
    1      4       5
  =====  =====  =======

.. Tests tables inside a panel are rendered outside the `.panel-body`
.. Tests multiple nodes, the table should be outside the panel LAST, the paragraphs inside.
